                                    <br/><br/>
                                    <p class="navy-text">Datathon is a celebration of data in which teams of undergraduates work around the clock to discover and share insights about large, rich, and complex data sets. Apart from the competition itself, which is the core of the event, there will be many other supporting activities ranging from educational workshops to networking opportunities with peers and industry representatives.</p>


                                    <h2 class="section-heading sub-heading-navy datathon">Who can attend?</h2>
                                    <p class="navy-text">Anyone who is an undergraduate or graduate student above age 18 can attend Datathon. No experience with data science is assumed. There will be workshops and speakers that students of any background can learn from! </p>

                                    <h2 class="section-heading sub-heading-navy datathon">What if I don't have a team?</h2>
                                    <p class="navy-text">You can still participate in Datathon even if you don't have a team. You can also form a team at the event during one of our team-forming sessions! A team can consist of a maximum of four people. </p>

                                    <p class="navy-text">Absolutely! We welcome students from anywhere, and will do our best to reimburse you for transport. Amtrak or MBTA will get you to Providence Station, just a ten minute walk from Brown’s Campus. </p>

                                    <h2 class="section-heading sub-heading-navy datathon">How much is this going to cost?</h2>
                                    <p class="navy-text">Datathon is 100% free. We will be providing free food, drinks, and swag!</p>

                                    <h2 class="section-heading sub-heading-navy datathon">What do I hack on?</h2>
                                    <p class="navy-text">We will be providing datasets, including, but not limited to, data from our sponsors. While at least one of our provided datasets has to be a central part of your project, you are free to use external data as well. The use of common data ensures a level playing field for all applicants, and encourages you to try different approaches with data you are not yet familiar with - a crucial skill for any data scientist :) </p>

                                <p class="navy-text left">Investors are continually pushing into new frontiers to find new and powerful data. But the more removed a dataset is from the financial or economic domain, the more challenging the inference problem becomes. Matthew Rothman, MD at Goldman Sachs, thinks economic relevance is an essential attribute of any truly powerful dataset. Furthermore, he believes the world’s major investment banks have a crucial role to play in creating, interpreting and protecting the most economically relevant data in the world.</p>

No prior experience with d3, the Spotify API, or javascript required, though it may help to have a bit of background with CSS and HTML.</p>

But did you know that large-scale 3D data is also increasingly available? This talk will focus on one such type of data: virtual indoor scenes, such as bedrooms, living rooms, and office spaces. I’ll discuss some of the unique characteristics of this data, as well as recent research projects using it.

					            <p class="navy-text left">The data revolution has upended the way science is done, and has touched nearly every discipline. It is no longer enough to discuss a problem solely through blackboard theories and clever debates. Now, everything is an empirical question. Data or it didn’t happen! But just as focusing on models alone can lead us to fall into the traps of armchair philosophy and confirmation bias, so too can focusing on data alone. I will argue for the importance of forming and testing defeasible models of the world, especially in the age of big data. I will present several case studies of how over-reliance on data and prediction accuracy--and lack of attention to underlying models--can lead to false conclusions and biased predictions with real-world consequences.</p>

                                <li>The event is open to students at any level from college through graduate school. Students must be over 18 years old to participate.</li>

                                <li>You can work individually or in groups of up to 4 people. For those who don't have teams, don't worry! We will be holding a team-building mixer on Saturday morning.</li>

                                <li>We will be providing datasets, including, but not limited to, data from our sponsors. While at least one of our provided datasets has to be a central part of your project, you are free to use external data as well. The use of common data ensures a level playing field for all applicants, and encourages you to try different approaches with data you are not yet familiar with - a crucial skill for any data scientist :)</li>

                                <li>Here are some broad categories that you can consider for your projects:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Visualization</li>
                                    <li>Statistical insights/correlations</li>
                                    <li>Machine learning models</li>
                                    <li>Interactive data exploration application</li>
                                </ul>

                                Or any combination of these! Your project DOES NOT have to include all of these areas. You may focus on only one. Judging will be holistic and will prioritize the quality/creativity of your overall approach irrespective of which direction you take.</li>

                                <li>You may not use any code that you wrote before the event.</li>

                                <li>You can use any language/framework/library/API that you want.</li>

                                <li>We reserve the right to disqualify/expel anyone who does not meet our code of conduct.</li>
