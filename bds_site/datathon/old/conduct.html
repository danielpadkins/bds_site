				<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

				<p>Rules to follow, and ways to report violations.</p>

				<p>Brown Datathon aims to be a welcoming, encouraging and safe event for all participants. All attendees, including sponsors, students, speakers, judges, volunteers and organizers are therefore required to abide by the following code of conduct at all times.</p>

				<h3>Summary</h3>

				<p>Our hackathon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).</p>

				<p><strong>We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.</strong> Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for submitted projects or any event venue, including talks, workshops, receptions, and online media. <strong>Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without travel reimbursement at the discretion of the event organisers.</strong></p>

				<h3>Full Version</h3>

				<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

				<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

				<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>

				<p>In addition, <strong>hacks or projects submitted by teams that violate this code</strong>, contain sexual language or imagery, or are otherwise considered discriminatory or harassing in nature <strong>may be disqualified</strong> or denied the right to demo at the discretion of the event organizers.</p>

				<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no reimbursement. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please follow the reporting procedures at the bottom of this document and report the incident immediately. Hackathon staff can be identified as they’ll be wearing branded t-shirts.</p>

				<p>Hackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.</p>

				<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues and all related social events.</p>
