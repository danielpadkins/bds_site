					<h5>The Alternative Data Under Our Noses</h5>

					<p>Investors are continually pushing into new frontiers to find new and powerful data. But the more removed a dataset is from the financial or economic domain, the more challenging the inference problem becomes. Matthew Rothman, MD at Goldman Sachs, thinks economic relevance is an essential attribute of any truly powerful dataset. Furthermore, he believes the world’s major investment banks have a crucial role to play in creating, interpreting and protecting the most economically relevant data in the world.</p>

					<h3>Dirty secrets of Data Science</h3>

					<p>Sun, March 5 at 2:00-3:00pm (Smith-Buonanno 106)</p>

					<hr>

					<h4>Onur Keskin, Software Engineer at Google</h4>

					<p>What's swept under the rug?
					Every company does data science to some extend. Some do more systematically then others, but unfortunately this is not a common practice. We can attribute this to the intrinsic problem of data science: Dependency to data. I'll showcase some of the bad practices and the impacts of these practices in the long run. I'll also share some anecdotes on how to avoid them.</p>

					<h4>Daniel Ritchie, Asst. Prof. of CS, Brown</h4>

					<p>The increasing availability of large-scale text and image data has received a lot of recent attention. But did you know that large-scale 3D data is also increasingly available? This talk will focus on one such type of data: virtual indoor scenes, such as bedrooms, living rooms, and office spaces. I’ll discuss some of the unique characteristics of this data, as well as recent research projects using it. This includes some of my own research on machine learning models which learn to generate new scenes.</p>

					<h3>Don’t Just Predict. Explain!</h3>

					<p>Sun, March 4 at 1:30-2:30pm (Smith-Buonanno 106)</p>

					<hr>

					<h4>Ellie Pavlick, Google</h4>

					<p>The data revolution has upended the way science is done, and has touched nearly every discipline. It is no longer enough to discuss a problem solely through blackboard theories and clever debates. Now, everything is an empirical question. Data or it didn’t happen! But just as focusing on models alone can lead us to fall into the traps of armchair philosophy and confirmation bias, so too can focusing on data alone. I will argue for the importance of forming and testing defeasible models of the world, especially in the age of big data. I will present several case studies of how over-reliance on data and prediction accuracy--and lack of attention to underlying models--can lead to false conclusions and biased predictions with real-world consequences.</p>

				<h2>Rules and Guidelines</h2>

				<ol>
					<li>The event is open to students at any level from college through graduate school. Students must be over 18 years old to participate.</li>

					<li>You can work individually or in groups of up to 4 people. For those who don't have teams, don't worry! We will be holding a team-building mixer on Saturday morning.</li>

					<li>We will be providing datasets, including, but not limited to, data from our sponsors. While at least one of our provided datasets has to be a central part of your project, you are free to use external data as well. The use of common data ensures a level playing field for all applicants, and encourages you to try different approaches with data you are not yet familiar with - a crucial skill for any data scientist :)</li>

					<li>Here are some broad categories that you can consider for your projects:

					<ul>
					   <li>Visualization</li>
					   <li>Statistical insights/correlations</li>
					   <li>Machine learning models</li>
					   <li>Interactive data exploration application</li>
					</ul>

					Or any combination of these! Your project DOES NOT have to include all of these areas. You may focus on only one. Judging will be holistic and will prioritize the quality/creativity of your overall approach irrespective of which direction you take.</li>

					<li>You may not use any code that you wrote before the event.</li>

					<li>You can use any language/framework/library/API that you want.</li>

					<li>We reserve the right to disqualify/expel anyone who does not meet our code of conduct.</li>
