					Brown Data Science is dedicated to creating and supporting opportunities related to Data Science for the undergraduate community.
				</p>
				<p>
					We bring together students interested in Data Science and Machine Learning by hosting workshops and talks, and through competitions in which participants gain real world experience analyzing data—often with access to unique and exclusive data sets.
				</p>

				<p>
					Working with the Data Science Initiative and Brown Computer Science, we hope to soon develop and promote independent study projects and internship connections. Brown Data Science is for everyone, so check out our upcoming Datathon!

					<h5>Why Machine Learning Should Change Health</h5>

					<p>The explosion of clinical data provides an exciting new opportunity to use machine learning to discover new and impactful clinical information. Among the questions that can be addressed are establishing the value of treatments and interventions in heterogeneous patient populations, creating risk stratification for clinical endpoints, and investigating the benefit of specific practices or behaviors. However, there are many challenges to overcome.</p>

					<p>Come and learn about how machine learning could change health!</p>

					<h3>Dirty secrets of Data Science</h3>

					<p>Sun, March 5 at 2:00-3:00pm (Smith-Buonanno 106)</p>

					<hr>

					<h4>Onur Keskin, Software Engineer at Google</h4>

					<p>What's swept under the rug?
					Every company does data science to some extend. Some do more systematically then others, but unfortunately this is not a common practice. We can attribute this to the intrinsic problem of data science: Dependency to data. I'll showcase some of the bad practices and the impacts of these practices in the long run. I'll also share some anecdotes on how to avoid them.</p>

				<h2>Rules and Guidelines</h2>

				<ol>
					<li>The event is open to students at any level from high school through to graduate school. However, we'll need a parental consent form from those under 18 (get in touch with us!)</li>

					<li>You can work individually or in groups of up to 4 people. For those who don't have teams, don't worry! We will be holding a team-building mixer on Saturday morning.</li>

					<li>We will be providing datasets, including, but not limited to, data from our sponsors. While at least one of our provided datasets has to be a central part of your project, you are free to use external data as well. The use of common data ensures a level playing field for all applicants, and encourages you to try different approaches with data you are not yet familiar with - a crucial skill for any data scientist :)</li>

					<li>Here are some broad categories that you can consider for your projects:

					<ul>
					   <li>Visualization</li>
					   <li>Statistical insights/correlations</li>
					   <li>Machine learning models</li>
					   <li>Interactive data exploration application</li>
					</ul>

					Or any combination of these! Your project DOES NOT have to include all of these areas. You may focus on only one. Judging will be holistic and will prioritize the quality/creativity of your overall approach irrespective of which direction you take.</li>

					<li>You may not use any code that you wrote before the event.</li>

					<li>You can use any language/framework/library/API that you want.</li>

					<li>We reserve the right to disqualify/expel anyone who does not meet our code of conduct.</li>
